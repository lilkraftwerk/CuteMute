# Zoomhue

## What

Change the color of a Phillips Hue light depending on your Zoom microphone status. For example, turn the light red when your mic's on, turn the light off when it's muted.

## Why

> Classic and famous broadcasters have an "on air" light. Why shouldn't your home office be as fancy?

## Setup

1. `npm install`
2. Make sure you're on the same network as your Hue system
3. Press the big link button on your Hue bridge
4. Rename `config.example.js` to `config.js`
5. `npm run link`
6. Copy `USERNAME` value into `config.js`
